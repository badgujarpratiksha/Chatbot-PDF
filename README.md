# Chatbot PDF Project

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a chatbot that interacts with PDF documents using a Large Language Model (LLM). The chatbot leverages a Vector database for efficient document retrieval and is implemented using the Lanchain library.

## Project Features

- **PDF Interaction**: The chatbot is designed to answer user queries related to PDF documents. Users can ask questions, request information, or give commands related to the content of PDF files.

- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: The chatbot utilizes a state-of-the-art LLM (replace with the specific model you are using, e.g., GPT-3) for natural language understanding and generation.

- **Vector Database**: Document retrieval is optimized using a Vector database, allowing the chatbot to efficiently search and retrieve relevant information from PDF files.

- **Lanchain Library**: The Lanchain library is used for seamless integration of the chatbot with the Vector database, ensuring a robust and scalable solution.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- Lanchain library
- [Specify the LLM library, e.g., OpenAI GPT-3]
- [Any additional libraries or dependencies]
